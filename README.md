## SeaORM Tutorials

This repository contains step-by-step tutorials on how to use SeaORM to do CRUD operations from simple ones to very complex online applications in Rust Language.

The tutorial is based on a software system for managing fruits in a fruit market.

The tutorials are

1. **Simple CRUD operations** - This tutorials explains how to use SeaORM to do basic tasks like create a table in a database, insert a row into the table, update a column, delete operations and logging the results to the console. The database used is MySQL
2. **TODO Application** - This tutorial shows how to use SeaORM, SQLite and PostgreSQL to create a realtime sync TODO application where a user can buy fruits from the mango market.
3. **e-Commerce Market** - A complex application to manage a fruit market inventory, supplies, purchases and customers. It uses SeaORM, MySQL and SQLite and Rocket Web Framework. SQLite is used for the frontend embedded database and has a dekstop front.
4. **Web Frontend** - This tutorial ports the frontend of `tutorial 3` (***e-Commerce Market***) to the web using  [Mogwai](https://crates.io/crates/mogwai) which is a pure Rust frontend web framework with support for channels.
