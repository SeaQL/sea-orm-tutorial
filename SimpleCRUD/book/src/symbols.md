# Symbols Used

### To show added or removed code from files, we will use comments or 

`+` to show added code

`-` to show removed code

`...` is used to show only part of the existing code instead of rewriting already existing code in the examples.

`$ ` shows an operation is done on the console/shell 

This will make it easier to visualize changes to a file
